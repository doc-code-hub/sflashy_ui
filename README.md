# Sflashy UI

This is a suite of **Flutter Widgets** for specific sflashy effects.


## Components

### TextRoller
#### Strings merge transition in an infinite loop animation

The widget shows strings in the order it receives them.

`waitDuration` indicates how long each string remains static before being replaced with the next. `wait` can be used instead to specify seconds.

`transitionDuration` indicates how long the transition between the two strings lasts, during which the text gradually merges. `transition` can be used instead to specify seconds.
